# The Role of Mechanism Information in Singular Causation
 
This repository contains the experimental materials and data. 

All experiments were originally run as online studies using the software [Unipark](https://www.unipark.com/). We here provide the experimental materials as "Print Versions" in HTML-Format. To display these Print Versions properly, it is necessary to download both the HTML-Files as well as the corresponding folders. 

For each experiment, we also provide a short video clip demonstrating one of the different between-subjects conditions.

The R-Code that can be used to generate the predicitons of our model is located in the folder "Exp1".
