1	east	1_justification_30_1	NO message was received at the station for the Western Castle, therefore no signal had been sent to the Palace. It is not possible for the Western Castle emergency system to have triggered the Palace alarm on this day.  The Eastern Castle did send a carrier pigeon and it's station did send a pony rider. Given that the Palace alarm is triggered, the signal must have come from the Eastern Castle.	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	1_u_0_1	11	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	1_justification_31_1	No message was received at the station for the Western Castle, therefore no signal was sent to the Palace. It is unknown what happened at the station for the Eastern Castle, but given that the Eastern Castle sent a carrier pigeon and the Palace alarm has been triggered and taking into account that it could not have been triggered from the Western Castle, I am certain that the Eastern Castle triggered this alarm.	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	1_1t_u_1	9	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	1_justification_32_1	It is unknown whether the station for the Western Castle received a pigeon or sent a signal wither by telegraph or pony, so there is a possibility that the alarm could have been triggered by the Western Castle emergency system.   A signal was received by pigeon and telegraphed on from the station for the Eastern castle, so it is fairly likely, but not 100% that the Eastern Castle emergency system triggered the alarm.	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	1_1t_1p_1	9	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	1_justification_33_1	It would depend on the time of day that the carrier pigeons were sent out as to who first triggered the alarm in this instance, though given that the pony riders are much slower than the telegraph system, I would expect that the alarm was triggered by the Eastern Castle emergency system.	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	1_1p_1p_1	6	1	46	2	-99	2424

1	east	1_u_1t_1	5	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	1_justification_40_1	It is certain that the Western Castle sent both a pigeon and a telegraph from it's station. It is certain that the Eastern Castle sent a pigeon and possible that a telegraph or pony was sent from it's station. I am leaning towards the Western Castle, but there is still a high probability that the Eastern Castle could have triggered the Palace alarm on this day.	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	u_1p_1t_u	3	1	46	2	-99	2424
1	east	justification_47	It is fairly safe to assume that both castles sent carrier pigeons, even though the information is unknown, because both stations sent a signal.  The Eastern Castle station sent the slower pony rider, so it is fairly safe to assume that the telegraph sent from the Western Castle station would arrive first, depending of course on the timing of the carrier pigeon, hence some possibility the signal from the Eastern Castle arriving first.	1	46	2	-99	2424

5	east	justification_52	The Westerrn Castle was able to send a message to the Palace but only via the pony method therefore it is possible the Eastern Castle triggered the alarm using the telegraph method. But it is not known if the carrier pigeon made it and, if it did, if they would be able to send a telegraph. As there are two layers of uncertainty, I'm more confident the Western castle triggered the alarm.	1	40	2	-99	2704
