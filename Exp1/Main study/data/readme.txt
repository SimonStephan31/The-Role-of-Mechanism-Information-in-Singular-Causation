The file "Exp1_data.txt" contains the experimental raw data in wide format:

The column "sID" denotes the subject identifiers

The column "Target" codes whether subjects were asked about the "Western" or the "Eastern" castle.

The different singular test cases are listed in different columns. For example, the column labeled "1_0_1p_1" denotes the test case in which target cause occurred (therefore "1" on the left side), its mechanism was inactive (therefore "0"), the alternative cause managed to activated a pony rider but not a telegraph (therefore "1p" and not "1t") and the alternative cause was observed to be present (therefore "1" on the right). "u"'s in the labels denote unobserved variables.

The column "Attention Confirmation" codes subjects' answers to an initial question of the survey in which they confirmed that they will pay attention in this study (= 1).


The file "DescriptiveStats_Exp1.pdf" contains a table of the descriptive statistics (e.g., Means, Medians, etc.).
