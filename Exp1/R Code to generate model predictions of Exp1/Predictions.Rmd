# strength between root causes and receivers, Rc and Ra
wcrc <- 0.6
wara <- wcrc

# strength of receiver components to activate Mc1 (the strong and quck mech component)
# (whenever Mc1 is activated it is assumed to inhibit Mc2 with certainty; whenever Rc is active it certainly would activate Mc2 if Mc1 fails to fire and inhibit Mc2)

# strength of mechanism components, Mc1 and Mc2
wmc1 <- 0.9 # the strong path
wma1 <- wmc1

wmc2 <- 0.6 # the weak path
wma2 <- wmc2


##### Alpha parameter

# Alpha answer the following question: if both causes are simultaneously sufficient to activate the effect, what is the probability that the alternative cause was quicker than the target cause (preempted the target cause)?

# The following assumptions are made: 

# - for cases in which the mechanism components of both causes are observed and the active mechanism component of the target cause is the strong and quick component (the telegraph) while the active mechanism component of the alternative cause is the weak and slow component (the pony rider) (and both happen to be sufficiently strong), then the probability that the target cause was preempted by the alternative cause is 0.1. In the mirrored case, the probability is 0.9. If both mechanism components are identical (symmetrical cases), then it is unclear who acted quicker, and alpha is assumed to take on a value of 0.5.

# alpha parameter in model 
alpha_superior <- 0.1 # for x_1t_1_1p_x
alpha_inferior <- 0.9 # for x_1p_1_1t_x

alpha_symmetric <- 0.5 # for x_u_1_u_x

wara <- wcrc

# strength of receiver components to activate Mc1 (the strong and quck mech component)

##### Alpha parameter

# Alpha answer the following question: if both causes are simultaneously sufficient to activate the effect, what is the probability that the alternative cause was quicker than the target cause (preempted the target cause)?

# The following assumptions are made: 

# - for cases in which the mechanism components of both causes are observed and the active mechanism component of the target cause is the strong and quick component (the telegraph) while the active mechanism component of the alternative cause is the weak and slow component (the pony rider) (and both happen to be sufficiently strong), then the probability that the target cause was preempted by the alternative cause is 0.1. In the mirrored case, the probability is 0.9. If both mechanism components are identical (symmetrical cases), then it is unclear who acted quicker, and alpha is assumed to take on a value of 0.5.

# alpha parameter in model
