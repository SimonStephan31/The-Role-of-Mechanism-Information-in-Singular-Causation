38	Dependent	observed_first	8	6	6	Lack of information in southern tower leads me to believe a signal wasn't sent from there.	Either castle could have successfully sent a request for aid.	1	19	1	-99	578
50	Dependent	observed_first	9	6	11	I am quite certain since the northern intermediate tower sent a telegram that caused the alarm to ring in the Northern Palace. The Eastern Castle also sent a pigeon but it might not have been received by the southern intermediate tower since the icon is black.	Since both castles sent pigeons and both the intermediate towers have black icons, it is a tossup whether the alarm was caused by the western or eastern castles.	1	23	1	-99	623
53	Dependent	observed_first	6	6	11	The northern telegraph tower can be activated from either castle sending pigeons. It is true that there are fewer links from the Western castle to the northern telegraph tower, and more things could  go wrong  from the Eastern side, but there is simply no information about whether this happened.	The only way to alert the castle is through the northern tower, but again, this can be activated by either the Eastern or Western castle sending pigeons. There is no information about what did/didn't happen.	1	32	2	-99	669
78	Dependent	observed_first	8	7	11	Because the western tower got the message, but it also could have gotten the message from the other castle (depending on the hidden information), there is a chance that either castle caused the alarm to ring. However, it is more likely that the western castle did, because there are fewer chances for error and full information.	Again, it is possible that either one caused the ringing, but slightly more likely for the western castle, because there are fewer chances for error along the path.	1	23	1	-99	797
82	Dependent	observed_first	11	6	6	no information was received from the southern Castel	it could be from either castel	1	19	2	-99	1041
92	Dependent	observed_first	8	6	6	We have no information from the southern tower, however, we have information from the western tower that they received an emergency call.    There is a chance that the call was received from the southern tower but there is a higher chance that it was received from the western tower because we know that they had got the information from the western castle.	Both castles sent out pigeons but we got no information from both towers. This means we can not assume who sent the alarm and it is basically 50/50.	1	18	1	N/A	617
102	Dependent	observed_first	11	1	6	The eastern station does not have any information of the event.	No information is available for either station so the King's Palace Bell must have been ringing from a previous event.	1	37	1	-99	1167
116	Dependent	observed_first	11	6	11	The southern castle telegraph point didn’t receive anything	Both the southern and northern posts are unclear therefore we can’t be sure	1	26	2	-99	756
138	Dependent	observed_first	6	6	11	There is no information from the Eastern Castle's Telegraph Tower. So it is possible that the alarm was triggered by them - as likely as it is that the Western Castle caused the alarm to sound.	As with the previous scenario, there is a chance based on the information presented that both castles sent out pigeons to their Telegraph Towers. Since I cannot say which sent their pigeon first (it is well noted that the Western Castle has overall less distance to travel to send an emergency signal) I must conclude there is a 50:50 chance once again.	1	42	1	No technical issues, I very much enjoyed this study and thinking about the scenario.	802
139	Dependent	observed_first	7	6	11	It could have been either castle, but the uncertainty of there being no information from the South tower tips me a bit towards it being from the Western castle.	I considered whether it could again be considered more likely that it came from the Western castle, as there are fewer points of potential failure. But in the absence of information I was mostly just uncertain.	1	34	1	NA	971
150	Dependent	observed_first	6	6	6	Due to one of the telegraphs having no info it isn't possible to say with 100% certainty	As before, not enough information available to say with certainty	1	53	1	-99	1749
152	Dependent	observed_first	6	6	6	Both castles sent a pigeon but only the northern intermediate station has a record of sending a telegram. The southern has no information so it may have sent one or it may not received the pigeon.  So the alarm could have been caused by either. There's not enough evidence to say definitively.	Both castles sent a pigeon but neither intermediate station has a record of sending a telegram.  So the alarm could have been caused by either. There's not enough evidence to say definitively.	1	44	1	-99	932
154	Dependent	observed_first	6	6	11	We don't know what happened at the East immediate tower because the icon is black.	Both immediate towers are black, we know a telegram was sent out, but we don't know which pigeon triggered it.	1	29	2	no	431
157	Dependent	observed_first	9	9	11	it is more likely for the western castle's carrier pigeon to reach its intermediate tower before the eastern castle's pigeon reached its intermediate tower to send a telegraph to the northern intermediate tower	same explanation as previous question	1	28	2	-99	532
161	Dependent	observed_first	6	6	11	theres no way of knowing	same as last answer	1	32	1	-99	523
170	Dependent	observed_first	9	6	6	The telegraph station relating to the Western castle was activated to send a message even if the other telegraph station wasn't	No information about signals received by either telegraph station so it could be either castle	1	29	2	-99	501
187	Dependent	observed_first	6	6	6	Both castles sent out signals, so either could have triggered the alarm.  There is no information from the southern tower.  I feel it's impossible to tell if the northern tower received a pigeon from the West or a signal from the East tower or both.  There is just as much chance of either castles pigeons going missing, so I've chosen 50, but suspect I am wrong and it's more likely to be the Western tower	Either pigeon could have gone missing, or both could have got through, impossible to tell	1	56	2	-99	892
193	Dependent	observed_first	11	6	1	The eastern castle transmitter is blank	both transmitters are currently blank	1	22	1	-99	1896
196	Dependent	observed_first	10	6	6	Because of the lack of information at the other intermediate station it makes it much more likely the Western castle triggered the alarm - but not impossible that the eastern castle sent it	No information to make a decision	1	61	2	Nil	596
197	Dependent	observed_first	6	6	11	Because there isn't any information for the Eastern tower which means the pigeon from the Eastern castle may have arrived. Therefore the alarm could have been caused by either castle.	There isn't any information for either tower, so it could have been either castle.	1	57	2	N/A	1935
204	Dependent	observed_first	11	6	6	The Western castle can only send pigeons to the Northern tower	Could be either castle as towers had a fault	1	36	2	-99	1416
206	Dependent	observed_first	1	6	11	The transmission tower for the Eastern Castle received no information. therefore no information was forwarded to the northern transmission tower.	Since both transmission towers received any information I feel like it could be either one that set the alarm off at the palace.	1	30	1	-99	1022
40	Dependent	unobserved_first	8	6	6	Looks like western got a pigeon sent and don't know if eastern pigeon arrived	Could be either	1	40	2	None	848
44	Dependent	unobserved_first	6	6	11	Since the first tower gives no info, there is no way to tell whether East castle's pigeon made it. Therefore either one could have cause the alarm.	Since there's no info an both castles sent a pigeon it could be either one.	1	25	2	-99	824
60	Dependent	unobserved_first	7	7	9	We know both castles wanted to trigger the alarm, but it's unclear if the first intermediate of the eastern castle failed or not, so it's a teensy bit more likely to be the western castle	Both castles wanted to trigger the alarm, but the eastern castle has one more possible point of failure so it's a teensy bit more likely to be the western than eastern castle	1	37	1	-99	605
68	Dependent	unobserved_first	9	10	11	Eastern intermediate is unclear. We can tell that the telegram was sent and that the alarm was triggered. So given the unknown its more likely the western that triggered it.	The intermediate stations both don't show what happened. However as the alarms has triggered AND the Eastern castle routes through the same intermediate as the Western castle then its more than likely the western one got through and not the eastern (unless both got through).	1	41	1	-99	620
72	Dependent	unobserved_first	11	6	6	only one station is up	no informations	1	32	1	-99	986
85	Dependent	unobserved_first	11	6	6	tower shows signal activated	Neither tower did anything that day	1	34	1	-99	285
95	Dependent	unobserved_first	6	6	11	Although the telegraph was sent by the Northern tower, it could have been triggered by either castle as we don't know whether the Eastern castle sent a pigeon before the Western castle, only that they were both sent at some point.	Both castles sent out pigeons, both towers have no information. There is no way to guess what happened beyond assuming a 50/50 split.	1	20	2	-99	614
105	Dependent	unobserved_first	6	6	6	Alarm bell indicates emergency signal was received, bird icon indicates signal was sent	Alarm icon indicates that an incoming signal successfully triggered the alarm bell in the king's palace, and the bird icon indicates that an emergency pigeon was sent out by a castle.	1	20	1	-99	781
117	Dependent	unobserved_first	9	8	8	Definitely the Western castle, maybe the other one.	"Shorter distance; easier to trigger."	1	34	1	-99	475
142	Dependent	unobserved_first	6	6	11	The western tower did send a telegraph to the palace which caused the alarm to ring. However it cannot be known which castle caused this. There may have been an error with the Western castle telegraph. As there is no information for the Eastern tower, it is unknown whether the Eastern call did make it to the Western tower. If both were successful, it is unknown which reaches the palace first and therefore caused the alarm	Neither transmission tower has any info for their day therefore there is no way of knowing which castle sent the call.	1	27	2	-99	634
145	Dependent	unobserved_first	9	6	6	I am fairly certain that alarm was caused by the Western virus because its intermediate station has received the message, whereas the corresponding station for the other castle is showing as no information.	There is no information received by either station.	1	42	2	-99	1348
153	Dependent	unobserved_first	8	6	6	telegram makes it more likely	both sent a signal	1	20	2	-99	560
158	Dependent	unobserved_first	8	6	6	both castles sent out pigeons however only the western station definitely received a pigeon so it is more likely to be the western castle since we don't know if the other pigeon made it to the southern station	both castles sent out pigeons but none of the stations had any information so it is impossible to tell which pigeon made it/made it first	1	19	2	-99	575
163	Dependent	unobserved_first	11	6	11	The western tower sent out a pigeon and the northern intermediate tower sent out a telegram, however the southern castle sent out a pigeon but due to the fact the southern intermediate tower has no information at all its unlikely the alarm was due to the southern castle	Both castles sent out a pigeon, and both intermediate towers have no informations at all on what happened that day although the alarm still rang at the palace therefore it's 50:50 to whether the western castle caused the alarm.	1	23	2	-99	1218
164	Dependent	unobserved_first	6	6	11	Both castles sent out pigeons but after that there is insufficient information.	Both castles sent out pigeons but after that there is insufficient information.	1	60	1	-99	1457
166	Dependent	unobserved_first	1	6	1	the east castle sent out a pigeon but the tower didnt receive any information so the pigeon must have went to the west castle the the north tower.	both of the castles on the east and west side sent out a pigeon and there is no way of telling who could of sent it out first.	1	20	1	-99	1607
171	Dependent	unobserved_first	9	6	6	Its most likely to be the Western Castle's request for help that was received, but this cannot be 100% confirmed because the East's telegraph tower had no information recorded.	There is no information recorded from either of the telegraphs.	1	18	2	-99	885
172	Dependent	unobserved_first	8	6	11	We don't know which sent their pigeon first, but the signal for the western castle definitely arrived	both castles sent out pigeons, but we don't know whether they both arrived (at least one must have arrived as the alarm is sounding)	1	29	2	-99	504
186	Dependent	unobserved_first	10	6	11	Only the tower cloest to the western castle was triggered but because there is no information for the east tower, it can't be ruled out that it wasn't triggered	Neither towers show any information that indicates which castle's pigeon was recieved	1	20	2	no	771
189	Dependent	unobserved_first	6	6	11	WE know a signal went from the northern telegraph . However, both castles go via this telegraph. Therefore, even though we can see if any info went to the southern telegraph, the fact the northern one is signalling and both castles sent pigeons makes it equally likely.	As both towers have no information and both castles sent a carrier pigeon, it was equally likely that the west or the east made the signal	1	21	2	-99	491
192	Dependent	unobserved_first	7	7	11	we know that the telegraph station that the western castle's pigeon went to directly was able to tranmit an alarm call to the palace, and as there are less steps needed than from the Eastern castle, I think it is slightly more likely to have been this castle	there is no information from the telegraph stations, but as there is an extra step to get information from the Eastern castle, I think the message from the western castle is more likely to have got through	1	47	1	-99	1368

155	Independent	observed_first	9	6	6	The triggers at each point are showing - the pigeon from the Western Castle, the telegram from the Intermediary, and then the alarm at the Palace. The only issue I can't be certain on is whether the Eastern Intermediary also sent out an alarm and it was this that caused the trigger, as the Western telegram could have been lost in bad weather.	Both Eastern and Western Castles sent out carrier pigeons, however neither of the Intermediaries have any information recorded for that day, so it could have been either.	1	28	2	-99	524
162	Independent	observed_first	3	6	6	I see a pigeon was sent from eastern castle and the pigeons can only fly in one direction.	There are too many spots indicating  no information.  Bell could have been going off from earlier in the day.	1	27	1	-99	1963

90	Independent	unobserved_first	9	6	6	Both pigeons were sent out by each castle however based on the information available, I know that the western castle was successfully able to send the telegram to the king's palace therefore indicating that the alarm was most likely caused by that castle however the eastern intermediate station could have also successfully sent the telegram before the western intermediate station but i can't be certain as there is not any available information from the eastern intermediate station to prove this.	Both pigeons from both castles were sent out but no further information at the intermediate stations is known therefore there is no way of knowing which station alarmed the king's palace.	1	28	1	-99	1299

121	Independent	unobserved_first	8	6	8	I know the Western Castle's alarm went through, so it must have caused an alarm at the King's Palace. However, the Eastern Castle also sent out a dove. No observations were recorded. Thus, the Eastern Castle may have caused the alarm as well. If so, it depends on which signal reached the Castle first. However, it is slightly more likely that the Western Castle caused the alarm because it's tower observations were recorded as having sent the signal through.	Both castles sent out carrier doves with messages, but neither tower recorded what happened.
