The file "Analysis_Exp2.Rmd" is the R Analysis script 

The file "Analyis_Exp2.html" is a knitted version of the analysis script

The file "Exp2_data.txt" contains the experimental raw data in wide format:

The column "sID" denotes the subject identifiers

The column "Mechanisms" codes whether subjects were in the dependent or independent mechanisms condition.

The column "Observation_Order" codes in which order the test cases were presented. 

The columns "1_1_u_1" and "1_u_u_1" contain subjects' singular causation ratings for the two test cases, respectively. The "1_u_u_1" test case is the one for which the mechanism variables were unobserved. "1_1_u_1" is the test case for which the mechanism variable directly connected to the effect is observed to be present. 

The column "diag_prop_rating" contains subjects' estimations of the probability that the mechanism variable connected to the effect was present in the "1_u_u_1" case. 

The two "justification" columns contain subjects' open ended responses for the two test cases. Subjects here provided justifications for their judgments. These questions were asked to increase subjects motivation for the task. 

The column "Attention Confirmation" codes subjects' answers to an initial question of the survey in which they confirmed that they will pay attention in this study (= 1).
