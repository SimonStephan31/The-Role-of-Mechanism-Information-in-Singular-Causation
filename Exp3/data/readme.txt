The file "Exp3_Analysis.Rmd" is the R analysis script

The file "Exp3_Analysis.html" is a knitted version of this script (output)

The file "Exp3_data.txt" contains the experimental raw data in wide format:

The column "sID" denotes the subject identifiers

The column "High_Strength_Component" codes whether subjects were in the condition in which the high strength component of the causal paths was the root or the terminal component.

The column "Target" codes whether the target cause was the Eastern vs. Western castle

The column "Observation_Order" codes the order in which the test cases were shown. 

The columns "1_1_u_1" and "1_u_u_1" contain subjects' singular causation judgments for the two test cases; the "1_u_u_1" test case is the one in which the mechanism components of both causes were unobserved.

The column "diag_prop_rating" contains subjects answers to our additional control questions. Participants were asked to estimate the probability that the unobserved mechanism component $M_A$ of the alternative cause $A$ had peen active in that case. 

The two "justification" columns contain subjects' open ended responses for the two test cases. Subjects here provided justifications for their judgments. These questions were asked to increase subjects motivation for the task. 

The column "Attention Confirmation" codes subjects' answers to an initial question of the survey in which they confirmed that they will pay attention in this study (= 1).
