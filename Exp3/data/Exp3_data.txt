4	Root	East	observed_first	9	6	4	The view from the intermediary from the Western Castle was obstructed, whereas the route from the Eastern Castle showed successful launch of riders along the route.	Both routes were obstructed.	1	32	1	-99	956
15	Root	East	observed_first	8	6	10	I chose my rating because the Western Castle is being blocked by a cloud, therefore there is still a chance the alarm could have been caused by the Western Castle and not the East. Even so, since we have vision of the Eastern Castle, my rating is weighed more to the Eastern Castle's side.	Both castles are being blocked, so I have no way of knowing who alarmed it. It is certain that the alarm was activated, but with no vision, it can be any castle.	1	21	1	-99	833

56	Root	East	observed_first	7	6	10	Although there is a low chance of the second pony rider making it to the castle, they did manage to on this day as the alarm in the palace was set off. However, I can't be sure that the western pony rider made it to the intermediate station as there is a cloud blocking the view, but I know that the eastern pony rider made it to their intermediate station so it seems more likely that they were the ones who set off the emergency alarm.	"We can't be sure which castle is responsible for the alarm being set off, as there are clouds blocking the view of both the eastern and western intermediate stations; therefore, even though both castles sent out pony riders, we can't be sure which of them made it to the intermediate station and was responsible for setting the emergency alarm off in the palace."	1	18	2	-99	1200

117	Root	East	observed_first	3	6	2	It seems that a pony reached the Western castle, and both ponies remain on the intermediate path and Eastern castle.	Clouds are obstructing the view	1	20	1	-99	502
139	Root	East	observed_first	10	6	9	I can't see that the intermediate station on the other side went out a second rider due to the cloud so to me it seems more probable it was the eastern castle that rang the alarm	Because both intermediate stations are obscured via a cloud its just as likely to be either one	1	40	2	-99	1129
146	Root	East	observed_first	6	6	10	Although we can't see what happened with the western castle's horse that's not to say they didn't make it to the intermediate point and a new horse wasn't sent out. Therefore we are still unsure who made it to the palace so I would say 50:50.	We cannot see what happened with either horse so therefore cannot draw any conclusion.	1	29	2	-99	862

2	Root	East	unobserved_first	4	6	9	It's difficult to know for sure. As there is a cloud over the intermediate pony station for the Eastern castle, we don't know if they were successful in sending out a pony. What we do know for sure is, the Western intermediate pony station HAS sent out a pony. So, from the information we have, it's slightly more possible it was the Western castle.	There are clouds above both intermediate pony stations, so it's impossible to know who was successful in triggering the alarm at the KIng's Palace.	1	36	2	-99	926
20	Root	East	unobserved_first	9	6	2	we cant see the final route of the western castle. it looks more likely to be the eastern castle but cant be certain.	both castles made a call, both have the same chances of being attacked and both have a cloud area, so the chances are equal	1	32	2	none	1076
27	Root	East	unobserved_first	7	6	5	There's a slightly higher chance because I know that rider survived the low-risk area, but it's only minimally higher.	As there are two clouds and equal probabilities on each side, there's a 50-50 chance.	1	28	2	N/A	602
57	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	10	clouds blocks other view so cant see if horse sent reached intermediate to then send on to castle. Eastern castle did reach intermediate and send onwards	both castles sent people, a clous blocks both clues, an alarm was set off.	1	20	3	none	941
72	Root	East	unobserved_first	11	6	4	There is a pony rider marker at the pony station where the alarm would have been triggered for the Eastern Castle path.	The baron rating is 90% and there is a cloud in the way so this blocks any judgement as to whether the eastern castle triggered the alarm.	1	33	2	-99	825
74	Root	East	unobserved_first	9	6	2	A cloud is preventing my view of the western intermediate castle. An alert could be sent by both.	Both castles sent out an alert	1	18	2	-99	722

86	Root	East	unobserved_first	2	6	9	There is a cloud on the west side	Could have been either really as the conditions on both sides are the same	1	38	1	-99	606
97	Root	East	unobserved_first	6	6	6	There is an obstruction of view from the eastern castle to the mid way point. I think the pony probably made it to the mid way point, but the next half was more dangerous	There is an obstruction of view, so I can't tell if the pony that was sent from the eastern castle ever got to the half way point	1	28	2	-99	809
110	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	10	What we know for certain is that both castles sent a pony and that the Eastern Castle's intermediate station did send a pony rider out to the palace. We don't know if the intermediate station of the Western Castle received the message for certain, because the view of the intermediate station is obstructed by a cloud.	I can see that both castles sent a pony rider to their intermediate stations. Both intermediate stations are obstructed by clouds, so it is impossible to determine if the intermediate stations received a message and forwarded it to the palace by sending a pony. As the probability of success is the same for both castles in this scenario, my logical answer is 50:50	1	36	1	-99	1547
114	Root	East	unobserved_first	6	6	6	THERE IS A CLOUD OBSCURING MY VIEW OF THE WEST SO I CANNOT BE SURE	BOTH EAST AND WEST HAVE CLOUDS OBSCURING MY VIEW	1	65	2	-99	1082

144	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	10	I can see that the first pony made it to the next pony station on the east, I'm unable to see if the western one did	it could equally be bother of the castles	1	31	2	-99	680
150	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	10	The Western intermediary spot is covered by a cloud so I'm not sure the pony rider made it there.	There are clouds covering the East and West sides so they both had an equal chance to ring the bell.	1	32	1	-99	1502
161	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	10	I know that the eastern castle successfully sent a rider from the middle station, but I don't know if the western castle's rider ever made it to their middle station. Because of that, it seems like the eastern castle may be responsible for the alarm.	My views are obstructed by clouds, so I can't see if the riders reached the middle station. At this point, either castle could have caused the alarm.	1	34	2	-99	704
168	Root	East	unobserved_first	7	6	2	I can see that a pony was despatched from the intermediary post (while this is obstructed for Western Castle). Both have similar chances of being attacked so the probability only increases slightly	I can tell that the Eastern Castle sent a rider to the intermediary station but there is a 90% chance of it being attacked before it reaches the intermediary station.  There is also a cloud that obstructs my view so am unable to tell if a fresh pony was despatched to the palace.  this is the same for the Western Castle	1	38	2	-99	1082

There is no way of knowing which is more likely	1	35	1	-99	1286
205	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	10	As you know the eastern castle has reached the middle, it is slightly more likely it triggered the alarm	Can't see either of the middle stations so it's a 50/50	1	18	1	-99	518
208	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	6	Seems more likely as we know the eastern pony definitely reached the intermediate pony station	it could be either of them. They both sent out ponies but the clouds block the route to the palace, so it's a 50:50 chance	1	27	2	-99	1033

105	Root	West	observed_first	8	6	4	There is a 50/50 chance of both messages getting through. However, as I cannot see whether the eastern rider arrived at the first station I that chance would change to be more favourable for the Western rider.	there is a 50/50 chance of both riders achieving their goal	1	55	1	-99	1384
121	Root	West	observed_first	4	3	2	I am uncertain which Castle caused the alarm because there's a cloud obstructing the view of whatever happened at the Eastern Castle's intermediate pony stable.	Again, I am uncertain which castle caused the alarm because clouds are obstructing the view in both intermediate pony stables.	1	25	2	-99	730

135	Root	West	observed_first	7	6	10	Both castles sent out riders and although we can't tell if the eastern relay station received the message to pass on there's an extremely good chance it did and forwarded it just as the western station did.	Both castles sent out a message. That's all we know, and there's an equal probability the alarm could have been triggered by either castle.	1	43	1	-99	1177
164	Root	West	observed_first	6	6	11	Both castles sent out a pony meaning that the percentage for either rider to get to the palace is the same.	Both castles sent out a pony even though we can't see which one made the percentage for both the riders is same.	1	21	1	-99	1025

178	Root	West	observed_first	6	6	3	Unsure it was caused by the Western Castle.	Unsure the alarm was caused by the Western Castle as there are clouds blocking the call.	1	25	1	-99	1572
180	Root	West	observed_first	6	6	10	I an see a rider at both castles but no information on who set the alarm, the cloud is blocking one stop.	There is no indicating factors on who caused the alarm.	1	36	1	-99	643
181	Root	West	observed_first	8	6	8	I have no information about the pony rider from the Eastern castle, so I put a little more weight on the Western castle.	I have no information on the intermediate stations, so its impossible to give more weight to one castle or the other.	1	29	1	-99	798
213	Root	West	observed_first	7	6	10	I know for sure that the Western Castle sent out a pony rider.  I know for sure that the Western Intermediate station sent out a pony rider.  I know for sure that the Eastern Castle sent out a pony rider.  I do not know whether the Pony reached the Eastern Intermediate station but I know there is a 90% chance that it did.   Given that it started as 50% chance for each castle I leaned slightly towards the Western Castle because of the extra information of knowing the rider made it to the intermediate station.	I know for sure that the Western Castle sent out a pony rider.  I do not know if the Western intermediate station sent out a pony rider.  I know for sure that the Eastern Castle sent out a pony rider.  I do not know if the Eastern intermediate station sent out a pony rider.  The probability given the available information is 50/50.	1	28	1	-99	1576
215	Root	West	observed_first	8	6	8	Although the view of the pony rider's path is obscured by the cloud(decreasing visibility), I cannot fully rule out that the Eastern castle wasn't successful in their quest. Also, the blocks with  X  is shaded differently from East and West.  I'm not sure how pertinent this detail is and can't recall it being mentioned earlier.	Visibility is obscured on both East and West, therefore I can't tell who triggered the alarm.	1	44	2	No tech issues.  Thanks for the study!	1740
216	Root	West	observed_first	7	6	10	It is likely that the easten pony rider got to the intermediate stop, but as it is unknown, there is more of a chance the western castle caused the alarm.	The chance for each pony to have caused the alarm is equal, as it is unknown if they got to their intermediate stops and the chances to get attaked are the same.	1	18	1	-99	1331

26	Root	West	unobserved_first	9	6	10	West pony arrived at intermediary, and a fresh pony was sent out.  Cannot be 100% sure that this pony arrived as barons may have killed him. East pony may have, but since I don't know if it arrived at intermediate point it's a lower probability	Both sent out a pony, both intermediate positions are obscured, and the alarm was triggered. there is an equal chance that west/east castle pony rang the alarm	1	31	1	-99	974
46	Root	West	unobserved_first	8	6	10	We can see that the west castle pony rider reached the intermediate station but don't know if the east castle pony rider did	There is no clear outcome - there is a 50/50 chance	1	47	2	-99	1495
51	Root	West	unobserved_first	6	6	3	I cannot see the Easten castles full view as it is blocked by clouds. Therefore I cannot guarantee that there isn't a pony under the cloud - Which would mean both castles have a pony at the half way pony shelter.	Both castles have the same thing happening in both areas - They are ponies at both castles being sent out. I have a view obstructed by clouds in both areas.	1	22	2	-99	914
64	Root	West	unobserved_first	7	6	10	We don't know if the first rider made it to the intermediate station or not for the eastern castle, but it's highly likely that they did. So we can't know for sure who it was	Both castles sent a rider to the intermediate station, but both intermediate stations are blocked by clouds so we don't know which one made it to the castle.	1	24	2	-99	537
78	Root	West	unobserved_first	11	6	9	The rider was sent to the pony station from the west castle, therefore it was likely they caused the alarm to toll	There is no strong reasoning either way that if it was or wasn't caused by the West Castle	1	29	2	-99	1234
82	Root	West	unobserved_first	7	6	6	Both castles sent out signals. Technically there is a high chance that both pony riders made it to the intermediate station i.e. 50:50. However it is difficult to be certain with the clouds on the eastern side, therefore I chose one option higher as there may be a higher chance for the western castle.	Both castles sent out an emergency signal, with both intermediate station being covered by the clouds therefore 50:50 chance.	1	30	2	-99	896
103	Root	West	unobserved_first	6	6	10	both castles sent out ponies, while cloud obscures what happened on the eastern route, it doesn't necessarily means anything happened to those riders.	Both castles sent out ponies, and it is unclear in both instances how far the emergency message travelled, so either could have caused the alarm	1	47	2	-99	706

162	Root	West	unobserved_first	6	6	10	While the cloud is obstructing the view, as the odds of the eastern rider being killed are 10% before the obstructed waypoint, the probability is not high enough to move to the next point on the scale.	Equal probability due to equal information available for each castle.	1	34	2	-99	570
170	Root	West	unobserved_first	5	6	5	Looks like west has more chance.	Both weat and east have the same conditions.	1	26	2	-99	1925

182	Root	West	unobserved_first	9	6	10	A rider was sent out from both castles, however I can see clearly that the rider reached the intermediate station for Western Castle.  There is a cloud obstructing the view for Eastern so there is uncertainty on whether their rider reached.  So based on this, Western is more likely.	I can see that both Castles sent out riders and both have a high percentage of reaching the intermediate stations.  But the obstructions by clouds present uncertainty.  Both castles experienced the same situation if we dont know what happened.	1	23	2	-99	978
183	Root	West	unobserved_first	9	6	10	The chance it was caused by the Eastern Castle is unknown but the chance for the Western Castle is good.	Both castles sent out a pony rider but clouds are obscuring both of the midpoints. Equal information is available for both castles.	1	28	2	-99	713
211	Root	West	unobserved_first	2	6	2	The Western Pony Station sent a pony rider to the King's Palace. The Western pony rider most likely activated the alarm.	A cloud obstructs the Western and Eastern portion of the map. It is equally probable that either pony rider activated the alarm.	1	18	1	"This study was entertaining; thank you so much!"	2151
214	Root	West	unobserved_first	3	4	9	I believe because their is 1 cloud so its unclear, no visibility to see. But because only a 10% on the attacks I would say the alarm was closer to not being caused by the castle.	I believe its 50:50 because their is 2 clouds so its unclear, no visibility to see. But because only a 10% on the attacks I would say the alarm was closer to not being caused by the castle.	1	25	1	Worked well	2424
228	Root	West	unobserved_first	6	6	1	Still 50:50 because although one is obscured by the cloud it doesn't mean that the rider didn't get through	both riders were sent out both were obscured by the clouds so we cannot tell which one triggered the alarm so it has to be 50:50	1	50	2	-99	782
1	Terminal	East	observed_first	11	6	2	We do not know whether the pony rider from the Western castle made it to the pony station, but we know that the pony rider from the Eastern castle did. There is a 90% chance that the next pony rider reaches the castle. There is a 90% change the first pony rider from the Western castle did not reach the pony station.	The odds are the same for both castles.	1	31	2	-99	608
11	Terminal	East	observed_first	10	6	6	There is no evidence that the pony rider from the west castle even reached the intermediate station, however it clearly shows the pony rider from the east castle has reached the intermediate station and a new pony rider has been sent to the castle. Since there is only 10% chance for that rider to be attacked, we can almost confirm that it is the eastern castle rider that triggered the alarm.	Pony riders have started from both castles but we do not know what happened later or who made it to the intermediate station. Hence there is a 50:50 chance	1	37	2	-99	1590
24	Terminal	East	observed_first	10	6	2	I can see that a pony has reached the eastern intermediate point, so it is likely. however, i can't be certain because a cloud covers the western intermediate point. there is a small chance that the western castle sent out a pony which also reached the western intermediate point.	There is equal chance that the Western and Eastern Castles caused the alarm as I can't tell whether or not the ponies made it to the intermediate points (because of cloud cover).	1	28	2	-99	895
31	Terminal	East	observed_first	6	6	6	the cloud shows we don't know if the riders went out for both castles. they have an equal probability of getting a rider through, just because we cant see it makes no difference to the probablity.	both castle have equal chances of a rider making it. not knowing about the intermediate stage makes no difference.	1	48	2	-99	888
38	Terminal	East	observed_first	9	6	9	The rider from the western castle only has a 10% chance of making it to the intermediary station, so it is very likely that the alarm was triggered by the eastern castle.	The information for both situations is the same, so it is a 50-50 chance	1	27	2	N/A	1235

It can't be determined which castle the alarm was from, since the chances of being attacked by robbers are equal, as are the chances of successfully making it to the King's Palace from the intermediate stations.
