35	Root	East	observed_first	8	6	3	We know for certain that eastern castle's rider reached the intermediate station however the western castle has a cloud over it so we are less certain that they triggered the alarm in the castle.	We know that both castles sent out pony riders but we cannot see whether either made it to the intermediate station because of the clouds so it's hard to say which was more likely.	1	23	1	-99	2543
44	Root	East	observed_first	7	6	7	Both castles sent out a rider, but we are only certain that one of the stations sent out a fresh rider.  The alarm could still be from either castle but because of the cloud I feel there is a bigger probability that it came from the eastern castle.	We have the exact same information from both castles and both stations views are clouded, chances are 50:50	1	38	1	-99	955
54	Root	East	observed_first	8	6	8	Both pony stations are selected but I cannot see the other pony station on the west. Therefore, the chances are that it was set off by the east.	Both pony stations are covered in the middle and both pony stations at the bottom are covered. Therefore it is random.	1	27	1	-99	2050
61	Root	East	observed_first	9	6	6	The rider from the eastern castle has certainly reached the intermediate station	It is unclear if either, or both riders reached the intermediate station	1	27	1	-99	463
63	Root	East	observed_first	7	6	8	I can't see whether the Western castle's pony rider reached the intermediate station, but I do know the Eastern castle's did, so I'm slightly more inclined to believe the alarm was set off by the Eastern castle.	I am equally in the dark about whether either rider reached the intermediate station, so I have no reason to believe one castle triggered the alarm over another.	1	26	2	-99	609
80	Root	East	observed_first	6	6	11	Becasue I don't know what happened with the rider sent from the West, I can't be certain that the alarm at the palace was caused by the east castle or not.	There's no way of knowing since both palaces sent alarms and it is unclear what happened at the stations thereafter	1	24	2	-99	595
82	Root	East	observed_first	5	6	9	The western pony definitely reached the intermediate station but we don't know if the eastern pony did. So the Eastern castle could have caused the alarm but we can't be sure, and there's slightly more chance it was the Western castle because we know the message got at least halfway there.	We don't know if either pony got halfway there so there's equal chance it could have been the Western or Eastern castle that set the alarm off	1	27	2	I think I got confused between east and west, sorry	1001

112	Root	East	observed_first	10	3	9	The cloud obscures the pony station for the Western Castle, but we know the fresh pony was sent from the Eastern's station.	I can't be certain as clouds appear over both pony stations.	1	40	1	-99	871
122	Root	East	observed_first	7	6	10	The pony rider from the eastern castle arrived successfully at the intermediary post, whereas it is unclear if the western castle rider arrived at their post.	I cannot see either intermediary post due to bad weather, so there is an even chance that both castles successfully had their messages delivered to the palace	1	26	2	-99	547
138	Root	East	observed_first	1	6	11	There is a pony rider in the Eastern Intermediary Pony Station, therefore the alarm could not have been caused by the Eastern Castle.	Both Intermediary Pony Stations are blocked from view. It's impossible to tell who set off the alarm.	1	27	1	-99	512
142	Root	East	observed_first	6	6	4	Both castles have called out for pony riders.	Both castles could have caused the alarm to occur, it is difficult to tell because of the clouds.	1	41	2	-99	701
162	Root	East	observed_first	8	6	5	we know a pony reached the intermiedate station from the eastern castle for sure, which makes it more likely.  But a pony could have reached the western from the western one too i just dont have that information.	It could be eitiher.  The same thing has happened from both fotresses. a cloud is blocking the way.	1	27	1	-99	733
171	Root	East	observed_first	9	6	3	A cloud is covering the west Intermediate station so there is not information that the new rider left the station. Whereas there is a picture that a rider left the east intermediate station.	There are now both clouds over the east and west intermediate station. So it is difficult to tell if riders left either station.	1	38	2	-99	2652
183	Root	East	observed_first	7	6	9	we know that the intermediate stable received the Eastern Castle's signal, but do not know whether or not the Western Castle's signal was received by their intermediate stable. For this reason I would lean towards the signal being from the Eastern Castle as there is confirmation of the first part of the journey being complete. Whilst this is true, it is still very possible that the signal from the Western Castle made it to the Western intermediate stable and we simply can't see, hence the hesitance to be certain.	We do not know if either of them reached the intermediate stable, so it is a straight 50:50	1	21	1	I accidentally pressed the back arrow on my browser and the comment boxes were emptied despite me filling them out when I first pressed 'continue' to reach the next page, so I simply pressed the forward button to go forward again and I hope that my responses were still recorded.

192	Root	East	observed_first	9	6	6	No is no indication if the western castle pony rider reached the intermediate station as there is a cloud.	"Both routes have the same diagram; there is no way to tell which castle triggered off the alarm,"	1	41	1	-99	879
38	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	11	there is a greater chance the alarm was caused by the eastern castle as we know the half way point sent out a fresh pony - we don't know the western castle did	both castles sent riders - both half way stations are not visible and both have dangerous zones so the chances are equal	1	34	1	no	1090
45	Root	East	unobserved_first	6	6	11	could have been either as both sent out and while west is obscured the robber barons come after the stations.	Both equally likely to have caused alarm as ponies sent from both castles but both journies obscured.	1	57	2	-99	1076
50	Root	East	unobserved_first	6	6	10	Both castles sent out an emergency signal, and the Eastern castle intermediate forwarded the signal. But I can't see the other intermediate to see that they sent on the signal, and either side could have been caught in the danger zone	Both castles sent out a rider, but the intermediate stations are in cloud so I can't tell whether either of those made or to the Kings Palace	1	37	2	-99	474
60	Root	East	unobserved_first	11	6	1	There are no clouds to show any issues were caused on the journey to stop the message from getting through	There are 2 x clouds on both routes which means I cannot see what happened with either pony rider	1	39	2	-99	660
69	Root	East	unobserved_first	6	6	11	Since the western pony house is obstructed, I cannot give with certainty that the eastern castle triggered the alarm.	Both middle intermediate pony houses of both castles are obstructed, so it is unclear as to who did it.	1	27	2	-99	540

97	Root	East	unobserved_first	7	6	5	the cloud stops us knowingh if the wester castle had a alarm	there is no way of knowibng what is behind the clouds	1	35	2	-99	823
105	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	9	Could definitely be due to eastern castle as intermediate castle shows it sent out a fresh pony rider. However due to the western intermediate castle being obstructed by cloud could also be due to that castle but it is unknown. If probability was assigned to the likelihood of an intermediate sending out a fresh pony from the original castle then could make better judgement.	Both eastern and western castles sent out a pony rider signalling emergency. Neither intermediate castle is visible so it is not possible to tell which intermediate sent out a fresh pony rider to the north castle. Equally likely to be either castle causing the alarm bell.	1	22	1	No technical issues .However upon completing the third question I realised that I may not have read question two correctly.	834
119	Root	East	unobserved_first	9	6	6	There is a strong probability the eastern castle caused the alarm as it's confirmed both stations were used however it is unknown if the signal was received at the second station of thewestern castle as it is obstructed by cloud	Both intermediate sections are blocked by clouds so it is uncertain if either or both received the signal	1	36	1	-99	981

146	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	3	The East rider definitely got to the pony station.  The West rider had a cloud so may or may not have got to the pony station  Therefore East rider is more likely to have got to King's palace.	East and west routes show the same events so it should be 50/50 chance of East	1	48	2	-99	906
161	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	10	I know that an emergency call successfully came through from the station that's in between the Eastern Castle and the palace. That makes it more likely that the alarm was caused by the Eastern Castle. I still don't know the situation of the station that's in between the Western Castle and the palace, since it's still blocked by a cloud. The robbers that are in between both center stations and the palace don't really seem to help either, though at least I can confirm that a rider was successfully sent out from the east station towards the palace. This  makes the chances of the alarm caused by the Eastern Palace higher.	Since both intermediate stations are blocked by clouds, and that both castles sent out emergency pony riders, there is a chance that either castle caused the alarm within the Palace. Both castles have the same scenario in that a rider from a castle was sent to a station. However we don't know whether or not a rider was sent out from these stations because of the clouds. Since the palace's alarm was ringing though, we can confirm at least that one of the calls from either castle went through. We just don't know which one.	1	20	2	-99	1449
164	Root	East	unobserved_first	8	6	9	We know both castles dispatched riders, but only know for certain one way station passed the message on.	We know both castles sent riders off, but have no further information about their journeys, so both are equally likely to have made it.	1	33	2	-99	445
174	Root	East	unobserved_first	6	6	6	Both castles send out alarms, but due to the Western castle's mid point pony station having cloud coverage, it is impossible to be sure which castle caused the alarm. Therefore, both castles are equally likely to have caused the alarm.	Due to cloud coverage at the midway point, it is impossible to tell whether the Eastern castle caused the alarm. Therefore, both castles have an equal chance of having caused the alarm.	1	36	1	I noticed a small spelling error on the page regarding the robber baron attacks. It reads  ...castles are quite save [sic]... , rather than  safe .   Thank you for allowing me to participate in your study.	1605
188	Root	East	unobserved_first	6	6	6	I cannot tell if the message from the west side of the castle was delivered to another pony rider or not due to a cloud being in the way.	From the information given there is too much cloudiness on either side to determine who actually caused the alarm.	1	27	2	N/A	806
190	Root	East	unobserved_first	9	6	11	The eastern intermediate station was successfully reached but the western is obstructed by clouds.

75	Root	West	observed_first	8	6	9	We cannot see what happened at the East intermediate pony station, so it's possible that the message was not received or the pony rider sent out was attacked. However, we know that the West intermediate pony station did receive a message, so it's more likely that the Western castle caused the alarm	We have equally little information about both castles so cannot be informed one way or another	1	19	2	-99	647
83	Root	West	observed_first	9	6	9	I can't for certain say the alarm was sent by the Western castle due to the cloud. However, the pony rider from the Western castle made it through 2/3 points, the initial pony rider was sent and the pony rider arrived at the mid-point station. However, the 1/3 is the bandit region. I cannot say for certain that the pony rider made it through the bandit region as the Eastern castle also sent out a rider. However, with the Eastern castle, I don't know if the rider made it to the check-point OR through the bandits granting a high level of uncertainty.	In this figure both castles sent out an alarm however, it is unknown which pony riders made it to the checkpoints due to the clouds. After the checkpoints, it is uncertain if they made it through the bandit region either. Since the level of information is the same for both castles and we know the alarm was rung, it's a 50/50 chance that either castle rider made it.	1	22	2	-99	695

176	Root	West	unobserved_first	8	6	9	Based on the info I think it's slightly more likely the West castle got through as there was only 1 stage it might have failed to get through (due to bandits) where as riders from East castle may not have got to intermediate station and even if they did may not have gotten to palace.	I know both castles send out riders for an emergency but I don't know if either or both were received at intermediate stations due to clouds over those locations, so the chances seem equal that either castle could be responsible for the bell at the palace.	1	34	3	-99	806

23	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	11	6	6	Eastern Castle shows that a pony rider was sent out to the palace through an area without robbers.	Both scenarios have the same details so it is difficult to tell who set the alarm off.	1	48	2	-99	1058
36	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	9	6	9	With the West Castle an unknown the East has better odds than chance of being the one who rang the alarm.	With the cloud blocking both intermediate stations there is no way of knowing which station made it through.	1	25	1	A few minor spelling errors unless I'm mistaken. But no issues otherwise.	1099
41	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	9	6	6	western intermediary station is obscured but I can see the eastern rider made it past the robbers so it's likely but not certain that rider set the alarm in the palace	clouds obscure the intermediary stations for both castles so it's impossible to say who made it to the palace	1	50	2	-99	781
53	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	11	6	6	I can see that the pony from the eastern castle made it to the intermediate post therefore I am certain that it was the one that made it.	As both castles sent out ponies, and both intermediate posts are obstructed, I cannot be sure which one of the two castles made it to the Kings Palace.  Therefore I rate it as a 50/50.	1	38	1	-99	942
56	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	8	6	6	Slightly higher probability that the Eastern castle started the alarm as second pony rider definitely sent, but there is also a chance the Western castle second pony rider was sent	Alarm went off, both castles sent pony riders but both pony stations covered with cloud so either could have started the alarm	1	48	1	-99	2844
64	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	9	6	6	Fair enough we can see that the Easter rider reached the station but for all we know the western rider could have also reached its station and deployed another pony.

88	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	7	6	5	Cannot see what happened at western, know for sure a rider was sent from eastern so think slightly more it may have been eastern	Both sent out riders. Alarm activated at King's Palace, cannot see events at intermediate pony statins, could be either that sounded alarm.	1	24	2	-99	497
102	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	11	2	3	The path from the Western castle  may not have made it to its intermediate station	I think the path to the palace from the Eastern castle wouldn't have arrived to the palace.	1	23	2	-99	616
108	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	10	6	4	The eastern castle rider certainly made it to the station, and on to the palace to trigger the alarm. It is unknown if the western rider made it to the intermediate station because of clouds, but the western castle also could have triggered the alarm	Both castles sent pony riders, and an alarm was triggered in the palace. However, it cannot be known which rider made it to the intermediate station because of clouds	1	28	1	-99	1061
111	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	8	6	6	The alarm could have rung in response to a message from either castle but cloud obscures some of the evidence. It is clear that the eastern rider got past the evil barons so it is a safer guess that he triggered the alarm.	The cloud cover obscures the sequence of events on the ground.	1	82	1	-99	1159
126	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	11	6	11	Theres a higher probability of the Eastern Castle causing the alarm as we know for a fact the rider made it, the other way station is clouded over.	The two way stations are clouded over, there is no way to tell if one or both of them made it so its 50/50 either way.	1	30	2	-99	645
130	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	6	6	6	Both castles sent a pony rider that day. The palace received at least one message, because the alarm is ringing. I can see that the East Castle's intermediate pony station received the message and forward a rider, so I know that their message is very likely to have reached the palace. However, the cloud is obscuring the West Castle's intermediate pony station, so I can't see whether the West Castle's intermediate pony station forwarded a message. They may have, so I can't be certain that the East Castle's message is what triggered the alarm.I can't remember reading a probability associated with robber baron attacks, to allow me to make a prediction about the likelihood of the West Castle's pony being intercepted.	Both castles sent a pony rider that day. The palace received at least one message, because the alarm is ringing. The clouds obscure the intermediate pony stations, so I can't see whether only one or both castles' intermediate pony stations forwarded a message.	1	33	1	-99	1603
158	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	9	6	6	The eastern rider did get through but the same could be said for the western castle but we cannot see if the western rider got through	The same icons are on both sides.	1	33	2	None	1892
167	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	11	6	6	the rider made it to the intermediate station and therfore would easily make it to the palace	Both had emergencies so it could be either castles horse that reaches the palace	1	20	1	-99	490
169	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	11	6	6	The rider has made it to the Intermediate stop whereas we cannot see the Western Castles rider.	Due to cloud cover, it is unsure whether a pony rider made it to the Intermediate stop.	1	32	1	-99	1629
189	Terminal	East	unobserved_first	9	6	6	It is certain that a rider from the Eastern Castle made it to the checkpoint so it is likely that this set of the alarm. However it is not certain as the midway point for the Western castle is covered by cloud.	Because both castles sent out a rider and both routes are blocked by cloud.	1	29	1	-99	477
24	Terminal	West	observed_first	11	6	6	The pony made it to the intermediate station, which means it likely made it beyond to the King's Palace.	Both castles' horses are obstructed.	1	20	2	-99	594
37	Terminal	West	observed_first	10	7	6	The riders from the Western Castle made it to the intermediate point. From that point there is no danger to the new pony rider. However, there is a chance that the rider from the Eastern Castle made it to their intermediate point and the new rider was able to trigger the alarm in the Palace before the other rider.	Fom the picture it looks like the distance of  the Western Castle to teir intermediate point is shorter than that of the Eastern Castle to theirs. So having a shorter distance to travel could be safer.	1	37	2	None.	1057
39	Terminal	West	observed_first	7	6	5	It could also be the Eastern Castle (maybe the rider from the western intermediate station arrived after the one from the eastern station, for example?), but I decided to put a mild preference for the Western Castle because we know for a fact that the western rider successfully reached the intermediate station and that it is highly unlikely that they were attacked after this point. I don't know exactly how common evil baron attacks are, but I assumed something like 50/50, meaning that if the western rider hasn't been attacked, the eastern rider may well have been.	As far as I can tell it could just as easily be any of them - they're in identical situations.	1	26	2	-99	1158
49	Terminal	West	observed_first	6	6	6	cannot be completely certain as the cloud is covering up therefore cannot say if the rider made it or not	cannot say as the clouds have covered the route of both riders so it could be either or	1	22	2	-99	1299
65	Terminal	West	observed_first	6	6	6	Both castles sent out a pony and the alarm was raised, but a cloud is obstructing my view	Both castles sent out a pony and the alarm was raised, but 2 clouds are covering the stations	1	40	2	-99	876
76	Terminal	West	observed_first	6	6	6	Both castles sent out riders - the western castle's rider reached the station but whether the east castle's rider did is uncertain	I can't see if either rider made their stations due to cloud cover	1	37	2	N/A	753
86	Terminal	West	observed_first	11	6	6	because the horse was sent to the station and made it there safely so another fresh rider would have been sent to the palace and would have been safe	it is not clear to see which riders got to the palace as the view is obstructed	1	20	1	-99	777
93	Terminal	West	observed_first	8	6	6	Without other evidence assume even chance of eastern castle evading robbers. Therefore western castle about twice as likely to trigger alarm	Both situations are equal in regard to the given information	1	48	1	-99	668
104	Terminal	West	observed_first	4	6	6	They are definitely closer. Other is 50/50.	Same hazards in both paths	1	58	1	-99	832

120	Terminal	West	observed_first	9	6	6	It is certain that  a pony rider left the Western Castle on that day and arrived at the intermediary station, which then sent on a fresh pony and rider, which would most likely have arrived at the castle and set off the alarm as there is a very low likelihood of attack on that journey. A pony rider was also sent from the Eastern castle but cloud obscures whether it ever arrived at the intermediary station and therefore it is unknown, but not impossible that a pony and rider was sent on to the castle. If a pony rider was sent from the intermediary it is impossible to say whether it would have arrived before tor after he one from the Western Castle pony from the intermediary station. Therefore on balance it is most likely that the Western Castle set off the alarm	It is impossible to say what occured after the ponyt riders left both the Eastern and Western Castles as clouds obscure what happened. The alarm has gone off so at least one of the intermediary pony riders was sent and arrived but no information to tell us which	1	48	2	-99	763

148	Terminal	West	observed_first	6	6	6	cannot be more than 50% sure as a cloud is obscuring the other rider	as clouds obscuring both riders there is a 50/50 chance it could be either	1	72	2	no	1349
151	Terminal	West	observed_first	11	6	3	Both pony stops are shown to have been activated as is the alarm at the King's Palace	It could be either because both show ponies leaving but then clouds obscure the view however the castle alarm is shown.	1	32	2	-99	495
166	Terminal	West	observed_first	11	6	6	Both the western castle and the intermediate pony station have a trigger, which means it must have been triggered by the Western castle at least.	As the alarm was triggered, that means one of the castles (eastern or western) must have triggered it. There are clouds on both intermediate pony stations, therefore I am unsure which it was, so it's 50/50.	1	23	1	None	1189
195	Terminal	West	observed_first	11	6	6	The icons show that is true	Both intermediate stations are obscured, so I don't know which one made it to the castle or if they both did.	1	68	2	-99	690
214	Terminal	West	observed_first	8	6	4	A pony rider that inadvertently came from the western castle definitely made it to the kings palace, however, it is also possible that the eastern castle also made it, and got to the kings palace before the other. 70% is a solid chance that it was the western castle.	Both castles sent out ponys, its unclear what happened on either side but at least one of them (1 out of 2, so half) made it.	1	19	1	There was a typo in one of the questions, although I didn't make a note of which.
